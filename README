============== API for crawling and storing Restaurant information ===================

This is an API to be used as a reference for crawling data and storing it in database for categories: Movies, Groceries, Books and Mobiles.
This project has the following directory structure:

Food_API
|-- database_schema
|-- foodpanda_api
|   |-- crawlers
|   `-- mysql_API
|-- zomato_api
`-- warehouse

1. Start with the foodpanda_api. It has two major components:
   - Crawlers: This engine crawls content from the foodpanda website and returns the relevant data.
   - Mysql_API: This creates a Mysql interface for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This engine stores, retrieves, updates and deletes the data from Mysql.

2. This project similarly extracts data from Zomato and merges the data in a common Warehouse. Thus, warehouse database contains the union of the information retrieved from both Foodpanda and Zomato and is a richer source. In the later part of the project, we will develop a warehouse.
